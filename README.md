# Flipkart Tool Optimiser

This tool crops the shipping labels generated by flipkart properly so as to support the 4 in 1 format while printing.
## Usage
- To use this tool, simply clone this repo / download the project as .zip file. After which process and download the shipping labels from the Flipkart Seller Dashboard.
- Replace the file in the repo named "flipkart-labels.pdf" (the name can differ) with the one downloaded. 
- Make sure that the file has the exact same name as it was before in the repo. Now, run the "crop.exe" tool. When the command prompt window opens and shows "Edited", the file named something like "flipkart-labels_edited.pdf" will contain the processed PDF. 
- Then you can proceed to print the file or save it, as you like!
